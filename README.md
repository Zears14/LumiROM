## Local Builds

The local build entrypoint is `./make`.

```bash
./make lumirom -d SM-A325F
./make lumirom -d SM-A325F --no-sandbox
./make clean
```

- By default, builds run inside a Podman-based Alpine sandbox and the sandbox image installs build packages automatically.
- Use `--no-sandbox` to run directly on the host.
- Sandboxed builds only require `podman` and `python3` on the host.

## How to Use:
#### 1. Fork the Repository
Give a ⭐ star to the repository.
Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

#### 2. Run the Workflow:
Open your forked repository.
- Go to the Actions tab.
- Select LumiROM Tools.
- Click Run workflow.

#### 3. Set Your Device Model:
Update your device model in the STOCK_DEVICE_MODEL option.
- If your model is available in /LumiROM/Device folder of this repository, the tool will work for your device.
- If your model is not present, it will not work

Quick reminder: FOD devices will use FOD bases, Side-FP will use Side-FP bases<br>
like if you have an A32, will use A34 base, and if you have A22, will use A24 base.

#### 4. Kernel BPF Version Option:
Set this option to True if your kernel BPF version is 5.4 (lower than 5.10).
- Otherwise, set it to False.

#### 5. Set Target Device Information:
Configure the following options:
- STOCK_DEVICE: The device model from which you want to port the ROM.

#### 6. OUTPUT_FILESYSTEM:
My tool can only build images in erofs because:
  - It is recommended if your device partition size is small.
  - Saves storage space.
  - Can add more things as it gets compressed

Only downside is:
  - Your kernel must support EROFS.

But all of the devices I support got EROFS kernel so there isn't a problem

#### 7. Upload
The ROM will be auto uploaded to GoFile servers, so when the workflow is done, check on the logs the link for it, in "Sending ROM to GoFile" part.

## Note
If you dont wanna mess with the repo or dont know how to do any of this things, I will continue releasing updates of my rom on my Telegram channel, that you can join clicking on the link on the repository bio.

Also I accept suggestions aswell as im still learning from it, so if you see a bug, or wanna make the code a bit more easy to understand, you can always create a pull request!
